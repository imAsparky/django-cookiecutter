Here you can choose how you want to get started and the commands are
conveniently described.

.. hint::

    If you prefer, django-cookiecutter can set the local repository up for
    you and get it ready for the first push, complete with a
    `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_
    style message.

    The option used by django-cookiecutter to do this is a slightly
    modified `â€¦or create a new repository on the command line`.

    To enable automatic local git setup, choose the default setting on the
    following option.

    .. code-block:: bash

        "automatic_set_up_git_and_initial_commit": "y",
