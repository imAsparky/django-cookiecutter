Django Project Features
-----------------------

#. Easy for new users to learn Django with sensible defaults.  Also, `local`
   and `test` environments default to using `SQLite`_, Django's bundled
   database.
#. More advanced users can change the test environment database with an
   environment variable to match the production environment. See the How-to `here`_.
#. `Django-allauth`_ provides authentication.
#. A `CustomUser` model, complete with tests and custom user types. See
   `How-to Custom User`_ for customisation options before your initial migration.
#. Improved  Admin panel security requires an authorised user to be logged in.
   The Admin panel now has the protections provided by django-allauth.
#. `htmx`_ built in by default using `django-htmx`_.
#. `django-tailwind`_ and `django-browser-reload`_ built in by default.
#. Customisable logging with rotating log files, see `how-to-logging`_.

If you are new to Django and Cookiecutters and would like to take it for a spin,
see our tutorial, `Create a Django-Cookiecutter Project`_.
