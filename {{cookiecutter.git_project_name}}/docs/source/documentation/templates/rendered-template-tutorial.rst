First Step Title

Select the tab for your preferred Operating System.

.. admonition:: Example - Using Admonitions

    You can use numbered step headings; however, well-described titles appear
    to flow in the TOC.

    Using Tabs can condense the page and group logical items together,
    for example, different Operating Systems have various commands
    to achieve the same outcome.

    See this example below.

.. tab:: macOS

    Do some macOS command.

.. tab:: Windows
