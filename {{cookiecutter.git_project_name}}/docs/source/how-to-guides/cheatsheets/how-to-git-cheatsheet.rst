Git Workflow
============

|

Excerpt from `Git Organized: A Better Git Flow` [#]_ that can be adapted to
many situations.

    Imagine this: you‚Äôve been paged to investigate a production incident, and
    after some digging, you identify the commit with the breaking code.
    You decide to revert the change:

    Unfortunately, in doing so, a new bug is introduced! As it turns out, hidden
    in that old ‚Äúbroken‚Äù commit was some code that another part of the app depended
    upon, and when you reverted those lines, it left the site once again in a
    broken state. üôÉ Oh dear.

    How can situations like this be avoided? To answer this question, we first
    need to examine how these types of commits come to be.
